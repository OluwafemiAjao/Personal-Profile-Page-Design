Objective Analysis of the Code
1. Purpose
This code defines a simple personal profile webpage. It introduces Femi, lists their hobbies, and provides contact details.
2. Use Case
A personal webpage for networking or online presence.
A simple portfolio or self-introduction page.
A beginner-friendly HTML structure for learning web development.
3. Requirements
HTML Only: No CSS or JavaScript is used.
Navigation Links: Three links (index.html, hobbies.html, contact.html) should be present in the same directory.
Image File: The <img> tag references "./image/photo_2025-03-28_16-54-11.jpg", so the image must be in an image directory.
Mobile-Friendly: The <meta name="viewport"> tag ensures the page scales properly on different devices.
4. Performance & Issues
Performance: Efficient since it's plain HTMLâ€”loads quickly.
